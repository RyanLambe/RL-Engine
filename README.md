# RL-Engine
### ***-This Project is not yet functional, please star and come back later.***


A Graphics Engine made using C++ and Direct X to be used in future projects.

## Goals(very optimistic):
- To be able to create 2D and/or 3D objects that can dynamically move around the scene
- to be able to create different types of lights that can cast shaddows
- add a physics system to handle collisions and forces
- add an animation system to bring life to the objects in the scene
- add a UI system
- add a sound system
