### This is a complete rewrite of [RL-Engine V1](https://github.com/RyanLambe/RL-Engine/tree/V1).

# RL-Engine V2
RL Engine is a 3D game engine and editor built in C++ to run on multiple platforms and/or Graphics APIs such as Direct X, Vulkan, or OpenGL. RL Engine also provides a highly intuitive and easy-to-use ECS (Entity Component System) for game object management, making the development process smoother and more efficient. To further enhance the development experience, the RL Engine also comes with a custom error and logging system, allowing developers to efficiently diagnose and fix any issues that may arise during the development process.

## Features:
- Graphics API Independent
- Cross Platform
- Responsive Editor
- Entity Component System
- Debugging system

## Build Notes:
- Ensure "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.xxx\x86" is included in your system Path environment variable, as fxc.exe is needed to compile shaders.
