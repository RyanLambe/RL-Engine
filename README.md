# RL-Engine

RL Engine is a 3D game engine built using C++ and Direct X, providing dynamic lighting, custom skyboxes, and more. RL Engine also provides a highly intuitive and easy-to-use ECS (Entity Component System) for game object management, making the development process smoother and more efficient. To further enhance the development experience, the RL Engine also comes with a custom error and logging system, allowing developers to efficiently diagnose and fix any issues that may arise during the development process.

## Future Goals:
- Physics System
- Dynamic Sound System
- Robust Animation System
- Documentation
