## Note:
I am now working on updating this project. I am working on it as a separate version, but the original code will still exist on the V1 branch.

# RL-Engine
RL Engine is a 3D game engine built using C++ and Direct X, providing dynamic lighting, custom skyboxes, and more. RL Engine also provides a highly intuitive and easy-to-use ECS (Entity Component System) for game object management, making the development process smoother and more efficient. To further enhance the development experience, the RL Engine also comes with a custom error and logging system, allowing developers to efficiently diagnose and fix any issues that may arise during the development process.

## Features:
- Dynamic Lighting
- Custom Skyboxes
- Entity Component System
- Debugging system

## Build Notes:
- Ensure "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.xxx\x86" is included in your system Path environment variable, as fxc.exe is needed to compile shaders.
